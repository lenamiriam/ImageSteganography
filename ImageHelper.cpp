                JPEG is a commonly used method of lossy compression for digital images, particularly for those images produced by digital photography.
                The degree of compression can be adjusted, allowing a selectable tradeoff between storage size and image quality.
                JPEG typically achieves 10:1 compression with little perceptible loss in image quality.

                This family of graphic cards was intended for professional computer image synthesis and video editing with PCs; for this reason, usual resolutions of TGA image files match those of the NTSC and PAL video formats.
